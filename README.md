Guidelines
You will have to submit this task with git (you can use Github or Bitbucket). After you are finishing make sure the code is pushed and send an email/skype with a link.

The code should be runnable on Chrome (don't warry about the rest), NPM start or something simple for run it.

Stack: Angular,Rxjs (or similar lib), ES6/ES7 or Typescript

The UI is just for demonstration there are no “point” for UX or design. We are looking for best practices, maintainability, knowledge general programming skills/abilities

You have this model
interface Asset {
	id: number
	assetName: string; // "USD", Samsung Electronics Co Ltd : "SSNLF"
	price: number; // asset current price relative to USD
	lastUpdate: number; // unix timestamp
	type: "Currency" | "Stock"; // asset type Currency (e.g. USD, EUR...) or Stock (Samsung, Google)
}
Mock
Creates 400 random assets, 200 currencies and 200 stocks (just the types is itersting, you don't need real assets) id 1-400 Create a stream from those 400 assets that fires 1 updates per secound for each asset:

price must be changed each update by -1 to 1 and with the current timestamp, the rest will stay the same
you can find the mock at mock.js It's exports a mock, rxjs observable with the required stream

This is not a starter or boilerplate it's just for confirm that the mock isn't brooken You still can boot your project how ever you want

see the mock running
npm/yarn install npm test

You should see console log with the object on the steam

Create the following app using this stream:
Show a table with all of the assets
Allow to sort for each one of the model fields
Allow to filter for each one of the model fields
Optional

Add to favorites button
favorites should be persist to localstorage
favorites should be pin to the top of the table
